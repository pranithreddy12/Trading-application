"""
scout_synthesis_engine.py — Phase 19F: Scout Synthesis Engine

Synthesizes heterogeneous scout outputs into coherent, confidence-weighted
institutional narratives.

ADVISORY ONLY — never emits direct trading signals, never allocates capital.

Inputs (from existing scouts):
  - RegimeScout → market_regime_memory
  - LiquidityScout → liquidity_intelligence
  - CorrelationScout → correlation_memory
  - ExecutionScout → execution_intelligence
  - Reddit/News/Discord scouts → external_scout_memory
  - SourceReliabilityEngine → source weights

Outputs:
  - Contextual market narratives
  - Scout agreement/disagreement metrics
  - Confidence-weighted synthesis
  - Environmental interpretations
  - Persisted to scout_synthesis_log
